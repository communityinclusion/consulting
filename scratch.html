<h2 id="rsa">2) Rehabilitation Services Administration</h2>

<p><em>Data Source: Rehabilitation Services Administration 911 database</em>. RSA-911 is a public access database that captures individual characteristics, services provided, and employment outcomes at the point of closure from vocational rehabilitation (VR) services. Records are at the individual level and cover approximately 600,000 case closures per year.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="ssa">3) Social Security Administration</h2>

<p><em>Data Source: Social Security Administration (SSA).</em> These data are abstracted from SSA reports on the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program and the use of work incentives. SSA reports the number of individuals on SSI who are working.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="demos">4) State Demographics</h2>

<ul>
	<li>State population is taken from the U.S. Census website.</li>
	<li>Unemployment data is taken from the Bureau of Labor Statistics website.</li>
	<li>Per capita personal income data is taken from the Bureau of Economic Analysis website.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h2 id="dol">5) Department of Labor</h2>

<p>The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) funds a wide variety of employment and training programs. StateData.info examines data for two of the major DOL funding sources: Wagner-Peyser, and WIOA. These are primary sources of funding for the infrastructure of the One-Stop Career Center system in all 50 states.</p>



<p><u>NOTE</u>: The data from DOL generally relies on self-disclosure of disability. These data may not fully reflect the use of these funding streams by people with disabilities, due to individuals with non-apparent disabilities who have used the services, but have declined to disclose that they have a disability.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="acs">6) American Community Survey (ACS)</h2>

<p>The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide survey designed by the U.S. Census Bureau to provide communities with a fresh look at how they are changing. It is a critical element in the reengineered 2010 census plan. The ACS collects information from all 50 states and D.C. on topics such as disability, age, race, income, commute time to work, home value, veteran status, and other important data. As with the official decennial census, information about individuals is confidential. (<a href="http://www.census.gov">Source: www.census.gov</a>.)</p>

<p>Note on why the ACS for 2008 onward is separated from earlier data: In 2008, the ACS changed the way it asks about disability. Superficially, the differences between the 2007 questions and the 2008 questions may seem unremarkable. However, there are critical distinctions between the conceptual frameworks encompassing the two question sets. Research conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau demonstrates that the 2008 questions should not be used to make comparisons to earlier ACS disability estimates.
