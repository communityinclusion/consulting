Continuous improvement is an essential requirement of vocational rehabilitation (VR) agencies. To take their agencies to a higher level of excellence, VR leaders have to find ways to innovate, measure progress, and support their staff to expertly meet the needs of individuals with disabilities, as well as workforce development systems. 

Our consultants can guide your agency through this process. We provide internationally recognized resources, expertise, and support to realize programmatic and operational goals.  
 
Common areas of continuous improvement:
- Organizational culture
- Leadership essentials
- Effective supervision
- Resources management (order of selection, eligibility, comprehensive assessment)
- Client-centered approaches
- Rehabilitation professional acknowledgement
- Employment-focused training centers (primarily agencies serving individuals who are blind or have low vision)
- Other program-identified needs
