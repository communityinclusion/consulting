### At your disability services agency, are you striving toward these goals?
- Improving employment outcomes for the people you serve
- Including people with disabilities in their neighborhoods and communities
- Keeping up with the latest state and federal regulations and requirements
- Moving away from sheltered workshops and facility-based day programs to support individuals in the community
- Exploring different ways of providing services

### We can help you and your agency navigate these changes!

The Institute for Community Inclusion empowers agencies like yours to provide high-quality employment and day supports. Our research-based tools and capacity-building resources support a holistic model of transformation. 

Working together, we can weave together employment and other community life engagement options to create a full life for the people you serve.

### We can help your agency: 
- Keep up with current standards. We can assess your strategies, barriers, and goals for enhancing integrated employment and community life engagement.
- Develop a specific, detailed action plan for success.
- Reach your full potential. Weâ€™ll offer guidance and resources, answer your questions, and track your progress.
